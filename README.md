## üìù Overview

[**Add a brief, 1-2 sentence description of your project here.** For example: This project provides a real-time data processing pipeline and API, coupled with a web application for visualizing both live and historical data trends.]

This repository contains the complete source code for the application, including:
-   A containerized setup using **Docker Compose** to manage all services.
-   A main backend application (`app.py`).
-   A high-performance **real-time API** built with FastAPI (`realtime_api.py`).
-   Scripts for visualizing **historical data** (`hist.py`).

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Containerized Services**: Easily run the entire application stack with a single command.
-   **Real-Time API**: A non-blocking, high-performance API for live data, accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
-   **Main Application**: Core logic for data processing or backend tasks.
-   **Historical Data Visualization**: A script to generate charts or reports from past data.

## üíª Technology Stack

-   **Backend**: Python 3
-   **API Framework**: FastAPI
-   **Web Server**: Uvicorn
-   **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
-   **Libraries**: [List key Python libraries from your requirements.txt, e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.]

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your system:
-   **Docker**: [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
-   **Docker Compose**: (Included with Docker Desktop)
-   **Python 3.8+**
-   **Git**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd [Your Repository Folder]
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Application

You can run the entire application using Docker Compose (recommended) or run each service manually for development.

### Option 1: Run with Docker Compose (Recommended)

This is the simplest way to start the entire application. It will build the necessary Docker images and start all services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

1.  **Start the services in detached mode:**
    From the root of the project directory, run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    - The `-d` flag runs the containers in the background.
    - The Real-time API will be available at **`http://localhost:8000`**.

2.  **To stop the services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

### Option 2: Run Services Manually (for Development)

If you prefer to run each service individually without Docker, follow these steps. Make sure you have installed the dependencies as shown in the **Installation** section.

1.  **Run the Main Application:**
    Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2.  **Run the Real-Time API:**
    This command starts the FastAPI server using Uvicorn. The `--reload` flag automatically restarts the server whenever you change the code.
    Open a second terminal and run:
    ```bash
    uvicorn realtime_api:app --reload --port 8000
    ```
    - The API documentation will be available at **`http://localhost:8000/docs`**.

3.  **Run Historical Data Visualization:**
    To generate and view visualizations of historical data, open a third terminal and run:
    ```bash
    python hist.py
    ```
